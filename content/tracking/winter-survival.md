# Winter Survival

Animals have evolved life-preserving strategies to survive cold winters. The following is a list of some native animals and how they survive.

1. What are mammals and how do they survive the cold winter months?
   - a. Mammals are warm-blooded animals (**endotherms**) in the subphylum vertebrata. Two characteristics that set mammals apart from other organisms are hair or fur covering parts of their body and mammary glands that provide milk for their young.
   - b. **Hibernation** in most animals is a seasonal period of adaptive torpor that allows the animal to survive regularly occurring seasonal change. Massachusetts only has three "true" hibernators: the woodchuck, meadow jumping mouse, and little brown bat.
   - c. **Torpor** is the dormant, inactive state of a hibernating or **aestivating** animal.
   - d. **Fur color** gradually changes from a fall brown to a winter white in snowshoe hare, long-tailed weasel, and ermine. The new white coat works as camouflage to hide the animal from would-be predators.
   - e. **Fur** becomes thicker in winter to help red squirrels reduce heat loss.
   - f. **Warmth** in numbers is how flying squirrels survive winter cold. They huddle together in tree cavities and use their body heat to keep warm.
   - g. **Microclimates** are created when gray squirrels build nests in tree branches or in a tree cavity. The dried leaves of deciduous trees are water resistant and keep them dry.

2. What are amphibians and how do they survive the cold winter months?
   - a. Amphibians are cold-blooded animals (**ectotherms**) in the subphylum vertebrata. Frogs and salamanders have smooth, usually moist skin. Most amphibians lay their jelly-like egg masses in water.
   - b. **Brumation** is the cold-blooded animal’s version of hibernation. Amphibians cope with cold winter temperatures by settling in a pond (bullfrog), under leaf litter (wood frog) or entering underground tunnels on land (American toad).

3. What are reptiles and how do they survive the cold winter months?
   - a. Reptiles are cold-blooded animals (**ectotherms**) in the subphylum vertebrata. Reptiles have scales and sometimes bony plates covering their bodies.
   - b. **Brumation** is the cold-blooded animal’s version of hibernation. Reptiles cope with the cold winter temperatures by settling in a pond (snapping turtle) or entering underground tunnels on land (garter snake).
